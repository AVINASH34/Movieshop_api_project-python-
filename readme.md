## üìù Overview

The **Movie Shop API** is designed to manage a movie database. The API is built using FastAPI, a modern, fast web framework for building APIs with Python. Pydantic is used for data validation, ensuring that only valid data is processed by the API.

This API is asynchronous and can handle multiple requests efficiently, making it ideal for high-performance applications.
